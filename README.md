### Hi there 👋

Here you will find a brief information about my professional background.

### What do I do? 👨🏻‍💻 

I have worked in the software development industry at many levels and positions and developed years of experience in the complete development cycle of delivering software solutions. I am also the author of the book "Hands-on With Go" by Packt Publishing, which teaches the Go programming language with simple and practical examples that solve many day-to-day problems engineers face.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineering Manager at @Adobe and leading multiple teams.

Besides my years of technical experience from monolith to distributed microservice architectures fully in the cloud, I bring the following strengths to your company:

1. Staying positive and offering clear guidance even during the most challenging moments.
2. Skillset to organize the teams that lost their aims
3. Facilitation of streamlined communication between product managers, engineering teams, and UX teams
4. A culture of passion, creativity, and innovation
5. Getting the team to have strong ideals with realistic expectations and mediums
6. Developing sound team practices
7. And, as a result of all these contributions, getting things done.
