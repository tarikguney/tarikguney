### Hi there üëã

Here you will find a brief information about my professional background.

### What do I do? üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 

I have worked in the software development industry at many levels and positions and developed years of experience in the complete development cycle of delivering software solutions. I am also the author of the book "Hands-on With Go" by Packt Publishing, which teaches the Go programming language with simple and practical examples that solve many day-to-day problems engineers face.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineering Manager at Motorola Solutions and leading a team that delivers scalable and reliable distributed cloud-native microservice solutions that are fully hosted in Kubernetes and using PaaS and SaaS solutions in Azure Cloud. Engineering quality software that is scalable and reliable to meet customers' growing demands and expectations is not easy. It requires hiring the right talent, the facilitation of effective communication among stakeholders, the efficiency of proper teamwork in implementing the proposed solutions, a sound team mindset, and being able to foresee roadblocks before they happen. These are the areas I am involved in every single day. I have led teams, helped them grow, provided them with both technical and leadership mentoring. When needed, I get my hands dirty by performing code reviews, contributing to the source code, and testing the software.

Besides my years of technical experience from monolith to distributed microservice architectures fully in the cloud, I bring the following strengths to your company:

1. Staying positive and offering clear guidance even during the most challenging moments.
2. Skillset to organize the teams that lost their aims
3. Facilitation of streamlined communication between product managers, engineering teams, and UX teams
4. A culture of passion, creativity, and innovation
5. Getting the team to have strong ideals with realistic expectations and mediums
6. Developing sound team practices
7. And, as a result of all these contributions, getting things done.
